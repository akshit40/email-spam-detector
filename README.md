# Email Spam Detector Project ðŸš€

Excited to share my recent project on building an Email Spam Detector! ðŸ“§

I've been exploring various machine learning techniques and their applications in natural language processing to effectively identify spam emails. Here's a detailed look at the project:

### Key Concepts Explored:
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Text Cleaning
   - Tokenization
   - Stop Words Removal
2. **Feature Extraction**
   - Bag of Words (BoW)
   - Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)
3. **Model Building**
   - Naive Bayes Classifier
   - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   - Random Forest Classifier
4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-Score
5. **Deployment**
   - Building a simple web interface using Flask
   - Hosting the model on a cloud platform

### Technologies Used:
- **Python** for scripting and model building
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning algorithms
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **NLTK** and **spaCy** for natural language processing
- **Flask** for creating a web interface
- **AWS/GCP** for cloud deployment

This project has provided me with hands-on experience in applying machine learning to real-world problems and deploying models for practical use. Looking forward to sharing more as I continue to refine and expand this project!
